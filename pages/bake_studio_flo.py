Hi friends, thanks for being part of this neighbourhood bakery

Iâ€™ve set up this little page to help with orders, not because I want to grow,  
but because I want to keep things flowing nicely.  
I still love hearing from you, and your messages wonâ€™t stop meaning something,  
this is just a small experiment to keep things smooth (for both of us).

Letâ€™s see if I can code my way to a more relaxed baking rhythm ðŸ˜‰  
Thanks for being part of this, you're the reason it works at all ðŸ§¡
